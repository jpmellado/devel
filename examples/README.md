## List of examples

### Boundary-free flows: mixing layers and gravity waves

* Case01. Shear layer with broadband ICs. Uniform grid. Kelvin-Helmholtz.  
* Case02. Same as Case01, but with stretched grid.  
* Case03. Same as Case02, but 2 scalars with different Schmidt numbers instead of one.

* Case06. Stably stratified density interface with discrete ICs: oscillating inversion.  
* Case07. Unstable stratified density interface: Rayleigh-Taylor.  
* Case08. Stably stratified shear layer.  

* Case11. Wave maker in incompressible case.

### Wall-bounded flows: channel flows and Rayleigh-Benard convection

* Case21. Rayleigh-Benard convection with Dirichlet boundary conditions. 

* Case41. Half Channel flow.  
* Case42. Same as 11, implicit solver.  
* Case43. Channel flow.  
* Case44. Stably stratified channel flow.  
* Case91. Channel flow with constant streamwise pressure gradient (Re_tau=180, rotation term for turbulent transition!).  

### Boundary layers

* Case31. Heated plate.  
* Case32. Convective boundary layer with quadratic chemistry in three passive scalars.
